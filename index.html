<h2>Amnesiac Wizard 2</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Friendly yet fierce competition
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player can enjoy the thrill of just mowing down tons of enemies with magic, but with the addition of friends.
The player can either cooperate or compete against other players. Friendly fire is turned on, so it is possible to kill each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Third-person Fantasy Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use WASD to move, Q to shoot, and E to use your skill. (Player 1)
Use IJKL to move, U to shoot, and O to use your skill. (Player 2)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To get enemies and players to be able to kill each other. Also to get the game states to work.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A confined yet reasonable arena, with monsters spawned from the edges.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in a world with various towns and kingdoms. The player is a wizard, although wizards are quite common in this world too. Occasionally, you will go into town to do business, selling potions, casting fire spells, COUGHcursesCOUGHCOUGH, but you like to live outside the town in your awesome tower. Of course, living outside the town means that you're more likely to be attacked by monsters, from small roving bands to giant hordes, but you have a barrier that you cast every morning to protect your home.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
After you recovered from drinking your amnesia potion (you idiot), you remember that you were supposed to meet your friends for a friendly competition in the afternoon. You gather up your stuff and head out, where you meet your friends. One of your friends has brought a contraption, which she claims will spawn illusory specters to be used in the competition. The task set among you and your other friend is to kill all the specters, no restrictions. Of course, this means friendly fire is allowed.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For people that like to compete.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Only 200 specters maximum, with the final specter being super strong. This could take a few minutes at most, unless players focus solely on killing each other at first.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Although the arena is bounded only by the map, try your best to avoid the edges of the map. They are generally bad places to be.
****NOTE that if everyone just holds down the fire button, everyone is liable to die.****
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch. Music from Animal Crossing: Wild World was used as background music, and a sound was downloaded to be used as the magic casting sound.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The concept of a minigame frome Wii Play was chosen, using their Tanks 2 player game as a model

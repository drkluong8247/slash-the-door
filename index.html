<h2>Slash the Door</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Why unlock a door when you can break it?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Rapid key presses to break down increasingly sturdy doors.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Third-person Fantasy Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to execute various attacks as you attempt to break down the door.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To get key presses to work.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Fast-paced button mashing
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in a world with various towns and kingdoms. Ignoring the antics of the Amnesiac Wizard for a second here, let us instead move on to the story of the Amnesiac Blademaster. Unlike the Amnesiac Wizard, the Amnesiac Blademaster doesn't suffer literally from amnesia, whether natural or through magic-induced causes, but the Amnesiac Blademaster does suffer from memory loss issues. It doesn't take away from the skills the Blademaster possesses.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As the Amnesiac Blademaster, you have quite a reputation. One day, after you finished some shopping in the village market, you return home and attempt to open your front door. However, your keys don't appear to work, and after much effort, you realize that your keys probably aren't going to work. Probably a broken lock or wrong keys or something, you don't remember. Anyways, rather than ask for help, you decide it'd be much faster just to slash down the door and repair it later. Of course, this door seems to be rather large for some reason..... are you sure you're at your house? Oh well...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For people that want to test perception and quick thinking.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Depends on the player
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
After pressing the series of keys that pop up, a new series of keys will pop up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch. Music from Animal Crossing: Wild World was used as background music, and a sound was downloaded to be used as the magic casting sound.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Uhhh.....
